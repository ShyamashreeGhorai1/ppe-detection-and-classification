1. First, we need to annotate the data. We run data_label.py to manually annotate the images.
2. After completing the annotation, we create the data.yaml file.
3. Next, we train the model by running training.py.
4. To deploy the model, we use FastAPI.
5. Finally, we run app.py to start the application and view the results.
