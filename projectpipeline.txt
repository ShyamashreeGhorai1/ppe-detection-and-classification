1. First, we need to annotate the data. We run data_label.py to manually annotate the images.
2. After completing the annotation, we create the data.yaml file.
3. Next, we train the model by running training.py.
4. To deploy the model, we use FastAPI. Since we are running it on Google Colab, which does not allow public web servers directly, we use ngrok(signup - https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup ->Take authentication key - https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken-> To connect with it use !ngrok authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE). 
If we run it on a local machine or another server, then ngrok is not required.
5. Finally, we run app.py to start the application and view the results.
